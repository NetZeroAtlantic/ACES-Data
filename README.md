# Introduction

Hi! Welcome to the ACES-Data repository. 

This repo is one of three related to the Atlantic Canada Energy System (ACES) Model.
The others are:
- The [ACES-Temoa](https://github.com/SutubraResearch/ACES-Temoa) repository contains the code
for the energy system planning model, based off [Temoa](https://temoacloud.com/).
- The [ACES-Dashboard](https://github.com/SutubraResearch/ACES-Dashboard) repository contains the files
associated with the data visualization dashboard..

This repository is kept separate to make tracking changes a little more straightforward. 

To use one of the provided .sqlite databases in the ACES model, simply drag it into the
`ACES-Temoa/data_files/` directory and follow instructions from the [ACES-Temoa](https://github.com/SutubraResearch/ACES-Temoa) repo.
